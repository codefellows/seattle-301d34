=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Today we will explore client-side route-based functionality to create a more performant and modular single page web application. These routes should be simple, with a single callback to render the page to the DOM.*

*We need to be attentive to when a server request is being made versus when the routing is intercepted and handled in the browser. We are finding new ways to blur the separation of concerns, in this case offloading some of the Controller responsibilities into the View layer.*

## Readings

## Learning Objectives

* Identify useful urls for an app, and be able to implement those routes given the new library presented.
* Recognize other server technologies such as Node, new dependencies

## Warmup: Review Questions

1. What is Node? Where does it run?
1. What is Express? Where does it run?
1. What is jQuery? Where does it run?
1. What is PostgresQL? Where does it run?
1. What is psql? Where does it run?
1. What is pg? Where does it run?
2. Draw our client/server/database diagram for the app we've built so far, specifically for the GET /api/v1/books route.
3. What does MVC mean? How does it relate to frontend/backend/database?
